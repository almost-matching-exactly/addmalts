# Welcome to ADD MALTS!

ADD MALTS stands for "Analyzing Distributional Data via Matching After Learning to Stretch" and -- as the name suggests -- is a method for estimating causal effects from _distributional data_. `pyaddmalts` is a `python` implementation of the method. This repository contains files necessary to replicate results found in the paper ([Katta et al, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10569)).

# Files
- To replicate results from Figure 2 of the paper, please run all files titled `cate_[method name]_experiments.py`
- To replicate results from Figure 3 of the paper, please run `positivity_experiments.py`
- To replicate the real data analysis, please see the `real_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook
